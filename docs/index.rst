django-webp-converter
=====================

Introduction
------------

django-webp-converter is a Django app which straightforwardly converts static
images to WebP images, falling back to the original static image for unsupported
browsers.


WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images
are 25-34% smaller in size compared to JPEG images at equivalent SSIM index
(https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?hl=en). By using WebP images, you
can increase page load speeds with no noticeable change
in image quality.
